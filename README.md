# 🌍 Air Quality EDA

Hey there!  
This is my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project where I dig into air quality data and explore how different pollutants behave over time.

The main focus is on:
- **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, Ozone,** and **AQI**
- Spotting trends, seasonal patterns, and any “uh-oh” pollution spikes
- Seeing how these pollutants relate to each other

---

## 📂 What’s Inside
- **EDA Project.ipynb** → The full Jupyter Notebook with all the code, charts, and analysis.
- **EDA Project.html** → A browser-friendly version of the notebook (no setup needed).
- **dataset.csv** → The raw data (if I can share it publicly).
- **pollutants_overview.png** → A nice summary plot of the pollutants.
- **README.md** → You’re reading it right now 🙂

---

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** → For cleaning and wrangling the data
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** → For making the plots look good
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Where all the magic happens

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- PM2.5 likes to spike in the winter (thanks, smog season).
- Ozone peaks in the summer months.
- AQI is heavily influenced by PM2.5 and PM10.
- Found some infinite values (`inf`) in the dataset — replaced them with `NaN` for cleaner visuals.

## 📖 How to Check It Out
1. **Quick look** → Download `EDA Project.html` and open it in your browser.
2. **Full experience** → Open `EDA Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?
- Break down trends by season.
- Try predicting AQI using machine learning.
- Maybe build a real-time dashboard for live air quality tracking.
